There are two playbooks here:

playbook-bookserver

This is used to install the electric-book-ui web server, with features for editing books online collaboratively.

playbook-bookworks

This installs the prerequisites for using prince et al - the back-end applications that are required by the bookserver, but that are not the bookserver itself.
