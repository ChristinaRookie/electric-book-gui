The Electric Book Manager is a web application for working with books. Those books are created as [Electric Book projects](http://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/).[^1] Your books are stored in your GitHub account.

[^1]: The EBM can see any repo in your GitHub account that has a `_data/meta.yml` file, which is a key element of any Electric Book project.
