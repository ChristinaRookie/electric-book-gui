# The Electric Book Manager

The Electric Book Manager makes it easier for non-technical editors to use the Electric Book Workflow online, without installing anything on their own computers.

Using the EBM, each user's books are stored in the cloud in GitHub repositories. Each repository uses the Electric Book template, an open-source tool for creating books and book-like websites.

This documentation is a work in progress. You can help to improve them by [logging issues on GitHub](http://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-gui/issues).

To see the documentation for the Electric Book workflow, including guidance on editing in markdown, go to [electricbook.works](http://electricbook.works).
