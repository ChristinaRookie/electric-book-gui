# The Electric Book Manager

This is work in progress. The Electric Book Manager is a web app for producing books with the [Electric Book template](http://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book/).

It enables non-technical team members to edit book content, review contributions, and output PDF and web versions of books.

[See the docs.](https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book-gui/)
