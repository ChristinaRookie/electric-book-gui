        <p>On Step 2 choose the free plan and don't tick the box for "Help me set up an organization next."</p>

        <p>You'll need to tell GitHub that you grant permission for the Electric Book Manager to update the books that you keep on GitHub. They call this "authorizing an application". <strong>You only need to do this once</strong>.</p>
